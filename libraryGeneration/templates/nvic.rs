 *  This library aims to provide the following :
 *   - a rust library generation tool to safely access memory ;
 *   - a support to flash STM32 boards ;
 *   - a task scheduling tool that generates the associated rust code.
 *
 *  The development of this library has done as a Proof of Concept and
 *  is currently only tested for STM32F407-G DISC1 Boards.
 *
 *  It is our hope that using this library to enable development on
 *  other boards will be facilitated.
